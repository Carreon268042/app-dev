### Sypnosis
"Five Feet Apart" is all about two teenagers, Stella and Cole, who both suffered in cystic fibrosis. They met in a facility where they were being treated and as they cross their paths, they find themselves drawn to each other. However, due to their condition, limited interaction only were allowed for the two. To prevent cross-infection, they were only allowed to be five feet closer to each other. The story unravels as they grew closer to each other and decided to fight for their condition together.
### What makes "Five Feet Apart" worth watching?
It's the way the movie makes you feel. It's this super emotional and raw story that just gets under your skin. The acting is amazing, and the chemistry between Cole and Stella is so real, it's like you're experiencing their love story with them. 

And, I think, what makes it worth watching is that it's not just a romantic movie – it's a story about fighting for life, about finding hope in the darkest moments, and about the power of love to overcome even the toughest obstacles. It's not just a feel-good movie, it's a movie that makes you confront the complexities of life and the importance of living in the present. 

### What to expect from the movie?
Going into Five Feet Apart, you should expect to feel all the emotions. It's a rollercoaster of a movie, with moments that'll make you laugh, cry, and maybe even scream a little (in a good way, of course). You'll be drawn into the world of Stella and Cole, and their struggles with CF will make you appreciate the little things in life. The romance is sweet, but it's not just a fluffy love story – it's a deep exploration of what it means to be alive and to be in love despite the challenges. And there are some tough moments too. But, if you're looking for a movie that'll make you think, feel, and maybe even inspire you to live life to the fullest, then Five Feet Apart is definitely worth watching.
